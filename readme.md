#About:
A diffusion-limited agglomeration script written in python.

Uses MatPlotLib to render a board of points, which are stored as sets of tuples of coordinates.

During the run, each new addition to the agglomeration "glom" is logged in a csv in /data/<start time in %Y.%m.%d.%H.%M" format>, and stills of the process are captured as according to the "frames to snag" setting used in parameters.py
